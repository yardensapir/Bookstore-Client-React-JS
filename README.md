# Book Store

Developed a single-page application that renders a fully responsive web app where you can browse through books and add them to your cart, using tools from the field of Full-Stack development, built with server side and client side.

## About The Application

It is built with Node.js, Express and React Framework with Javascript. In addition the application's database is MongoDB with the use of an ODM like Mongoose. Additionally the application has basic authentication and authorization functionality with the use of JWT. The application also uses JWT tokens for users.

In the applicaiton we can add books to the database, edit them and delete them. Users can signup, login, edit, and delete their data. In addition, each user has their own cart, where they can store books they want to buy, and checkout if they wish too.
